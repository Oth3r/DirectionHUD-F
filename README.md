DirectionHUD is a fully customizable Minecraft Fabric mod that enhances the vanilla experience. 
With the mod, you can save coordinates, track other players, see death locations, all with full customization to the HUD and Destination commands.

\
***Where does the mod work?*** - DirectionHUD both works on client and server, but for now the client side only supports single player. With anything that can change with time.
\
***Why is it coded like a plugin?*** - DirectionHUD is a port of one of my old private plugins; it might be ported back to spigot later on.

## Future Goals

* Spigot port (Coming soon)
* Client UI
  * Straying away from the plugin feel for client users.
