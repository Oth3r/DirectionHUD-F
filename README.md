# DirectionHUD (FABRIC)
DirectionHUD is a fully customizable Minecraft Fabric mod 
that enhances the vanilla experience. 
With the mod, you can save coordinates, track other players, see death locations, all with full customization to the HUD and Destination commands.

<br>
***Where does the mod work?*** - DirectionHUD both works on client and server, but for now the client side only supports single player. With anything that can change with time.
<br>
***Why is it coded like a plugin?*** - DirectionHUD is a port of one of my old private plugins; it might be ported back to spigot later on. <br>

### Config Settings
Set config settings to set defaults when running on server, 
or use modmenu + clothconfig on client. (currently not working, waiting for a mod menu update) <br>
**/directionhud defaults** also works on the client - set defaults to your current settings with one click <br>

## Future Goals

### More customization
* Disabling certain commands in config
* Turn off lastdeath in settings, since minecraft added the recovery compass (I made that feature before they added that smh)
* Setting limits to certain thing's ect.

### Client UI
Straying away from the plugin feel for client users.<br>
Custom GUI for the mod, and more! (Not on the todo list for a long time unless high demand)
